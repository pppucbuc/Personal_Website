              description="This is a web application completed in 24 hours for MHacks 14. It's an AI chatbot and grade tracker that helps students predict their 
              course grades based on past performance. Think of it as a crystal ball for your GPAâ€”giving you valuable insights to help you stay on track
              toward your academic goals. Sqoreo also provides personalized feedback, preventing students from getting overly discouraged by one or two
              poor performances. With Sqoreo, you can monitor your progress in real-time, with predictions based on three possible scenarios: Trend
                (maintaining your current performance), Regress (a dip in performance), and Improve (an upward trajectory).The web application was developed 
                using Python for the backend and React for the frontend. It also integrates API, Jupyter Notebook, and OpenAI GPT-4o."

              description="This is the final project of ME350 course. It is controlled by Raspberry Pi and integrates gyroscope, motor encoders, and camera. The robot utilizes the gyroscope and motor encoders to continuously adjust its path from the road's edges. The camera allows the robot to recognize road signs and make informed decisions. Its robot arm can hold the robot up, making it climb on steps. Its tank tracks help it travel on sand easily."

              description="These robots were built by Shanghai Jiao Tong University VEX Robotics Team for 2023-24 VEX Robotics World Championship. The entire structure is crafted using milled parts. The large robot's chassis is powered by 8 motors, while the smaller one is driven by 12 motors. Both robots are equipped with gyroscopes, tracking wheels, and motor encoders for precise path planning and autonomous navigation. Pneumatic systems are extensively used throughout the robots to control wings, shovels, and climbers, assisting in specific scoring tasks such as pushing balls into holes and climbing scoring poles. These are likely among the most powerful machines that undergraduates can build at the university level."
